    <h1>Orchid's Curse - We Are All Cynics and Liars</h1>
    <p>Why must, we cling, to the thread, beyond that of our identities
Shielding our thoughts, we pretend it's okay
Forget the lies and hold the disdain
We chase the fate that we believe - believe that we all deserve
Yet we hate, we hate the place were we have decided to lay our heads at night
I'm not too proud but I still can't admit it to myself
Why must, we stain, the hands, of our own being
The patron saints and sinners came
From far and wide, all to witness </p>
