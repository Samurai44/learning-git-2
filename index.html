    <h1>Orchid's Curse - We Are All Cynics and Liars</h1>
    <p>Why must, we cling, to the thread, beyond that of our identities
Shielding our thoughts, we pretend it's okay
Forget the lies and hold the disdain
We chase the fate that we believe - believe that we all deserve
Yet we hate, we hate the place were we have decided to lay our heads at night
I'm not too proud but I still can't admit it to myself
Why must, we stain, the hands, of our own being
The patron saints and sinners came
From far and wide, all to witness </p>
    <p>But are we not all just cynics and liars, armchair critics hidden by desires 
Under guise of perpetual demons, we will all burn in our fires 
This is not the way we should deem the values of our own being
If we detest our own reflection can we forgive our imperfections?
What if we were to look 
Without these lies, would we conceive 
more of compassion and less beliefs? 
We hate this face that we can see - we can see is so hopeless 
      And we place, we place the fate that we conceived to where our heads should lay...</p>
